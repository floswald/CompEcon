## Introduction and: Why Julia?

In this section we want to understand why julia is a good choice for computational tasks - for Economists and others.

## Basics: REPL, VSCode, Notebooks

We will repeat the basics of julia in a very condensed manner by going through steps 1-7 of [MoJuWo](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org) live in class.

julia REPL:

VScode:

Notice how there is a julia REPL running _as part of_ the VSCode editor. This is called an _integrated development environment_ (IDE). Very similar to an `R` session connected to `RStudio`, or the `python` interpreter being run through `PyCharm` etc.



## Notebooks

We use several Pluto.jl notebooks in this lecture. Here are four rendered ones:

Topic | rendered Notebook | source of notebook
:-----: | :--------: | :-------:
Variables | [click](https://floswald.github.io/julia-bootcamp/01-variables.html) | [click](https://github.com/floswald/CompEcon/raw/refs/heads/main/notebooks/week1/01-variables.jl)
Functions | [click](https://floswald.github.io/julia-bootcamp/02-functions.html) | [click](https://github.com/floswald/CompEcon/raw/refs/heads/main/notebooks/week1/02-functions.jl)

Please download and run the [00-fast.jl](https://github.com/floswald/CompEcon/raw/refs/heads/main/notebooks/week1/00-fast.jl) notebook on your own computer for the benchmarks! (Right click and copy link, then insert into a Pluto browser!)🏎️
