title: "Lecture 10: Dynamic Discrete Choice Models"

## The Rust Bus Model


* We gave an overview of discrete choice models on the board (also contained in the first notebook below)
* We introduced the bus model.
* We did talk about estimation of dynamic programming models. [Here](/assets/tex/dp-estimation/dp-estimation.pdf) are some slides.




Here are some notebooks!
