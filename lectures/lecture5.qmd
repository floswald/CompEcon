title: "Lecture 5: Dynamic Programming"
---

We introduced the Dynamic Programming technique by means of the well known _cake eating_ problem. We showed probably the simplest way to solve for the optimal decision rule, on a discrete grid. We _also_ showed that this can lead to really poor results, so **implementation details matter** here. We introduced uncertainty and we looked at an Euler Equation solver for a consumption savings problem.
