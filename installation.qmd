On this page you find the relevant installation instructions for this course. Please come with all components installed to the first class.

# Your OS

You need an up to date operating system. If you have not updated this in a while - **now** is the moment to do so. 🍜

After you are back, make sure you have all tools needed for modern scientific computing on board. There are 2 cases:

1. You have a windows computer: We need to do some work here.
2. You do not have a windows computer: Relax.

## Windows

* You need at least windows 10, better windows 11.
* You need to install the *Windows Subsystem for Windows* (WSL) version 2, i.e. WSL2. You should never just do what I say, but instead consult [the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Therein, you will see that installing this is as easy as typing

    ```powershell
    # start your PowerShell as Administrator
    # (right click on PowerShell...)
    wsl --install
    # choose all the default settings (in particular, install the Ubuntu Distribution)
    # restart your computer after this is completed.
    ```
* After successful installation and restart, have a look at your file browser. There is a like a second filesystem now - the one for linux!
* Start the Ubuntu terminal by typing "Ubuntu" in your Windows Start Button.
* In the running terminal type commands, followed each time by `enter`:
    
    ```powershell
    pwd  # tells you where you are
    whoami # tells you who you are 
    hostname # tells you the name of this host
    ```

## `*nix`

Computers *not* running a Windows OS are typically grouped together under the term `*nix` (*star nix*) - i.e. most current unix based OS out there. *This includes MacOS*. 

If you have one of those, you have it easier. 

### MacOS

Open the terminal application and type

```
git --version
```

if that throws an error, type

```
xcode-select --install
```

### Ubuntu

If you have any Linux distribution (Ubuntu, RedHat etc), just make sure you have the main tools installed.

```
# type this and enter
which git make gcc python3
```

You could then install any missing packages with

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git python3 python-is-python3
```


# Install Julia 

## via `juliaup`

The best way to install julia (allows for multiple installed versions and will always alert to new releases) is via the instructions at [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) - please follow those for your OS.


## via direct download

you can equally well download the current release for your OS from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)


# Run Julia

After installing, **make sure that you can run Julia**. If you installed via `juliaup`, you should be able to start julia from your command line now by typing `julia` and hitting enter. Otherwise just launch the julia app from your Applications folder.

*Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate `1+1` before proceeding!*

# Install [`Pluto`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)

Next we will install the [**Pluto notebook**](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/blob/master/README.md) that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia _programming environment_ designed for interactivity and quick experiments.

Open the **Julia REPL**. This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot.

Here you type _Julia commands_, and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result.

To install Pluto, we want to run a _package manager command_. To switch from _Julia_ mode to _Pkg_ mode, type `]` (closing square bracket) at the `julia>` prompt:
```julia
julia> ]

(@v1.12) pkg>
```

The line turns blue and the prompt changes to `pkg>`, telling you that you are now in _package manager mode_. This mode allows you to do operations on **packages** (also called libraries).

To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to *add* (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.
You should only need to do this *once* for each installation of Julia:

```julia
(@v1.12) pkg> add Pluto
```

This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea!

You can now close the terminal.

# Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome

We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best.


## Second time: _Running Pluto & opening a notebook_
Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment which requires Pluto.

### Start Pluto

Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type:
```julia
julia> using Pluto

julia> Pluto.run()
```

The terminal tells us to go to `http://localhost:1234/` (or a similar URL). Let's open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar.

> If you're curious about what a _Pluto notebook_ looks like, have a look at the **sample notebooks**. Samples 1, 2 and 6 may be useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. 
> 
> If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the [JuliaCon presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAF8DjrQSSk).

If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again.

### Opening a notebook from the web

This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a _template notebook_, available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can _paste the URL into the blue box_ and press ENTER.

For example, homework 0 is available [here](https://github.com/mitmath/18S191/blob/master/homework/homework0/hw0.jl). Copy this link (right click -> Copy Link), and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box.

**The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below.** 

### Opening an existing notebook file
When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off.

If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its _full path_ into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3.

# Saving a notebook
We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. 

Next, we need to know the _absolute path_ of that folder. Here's how you do that in [Windows](https://www.top-password.com/blog/copy-full-path-of-a-folder-file-in-windows/), [MacOS](https://www.josharcher.uk/code/find-path-to-folder-on-mac/) and [Ubuntu]().

For example, you might have:

- `C:\\Users\\fonsi\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\` on Windows

- `/Users/fonsi/Documents/18S191_assignments/` on MacOS

- `/home/fonsi/Documents/18S191_assignments/` on Ubuntu

Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on _"Save notebook..."_.

This is where you type the **new path+filename for your notebook**:

Click _Choose_.

# Sharing a notebook

After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created above. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment. You can click on the *share* symbol on top and choose to export it as a static HTML file, for example, or a PDF. 


# Install VSCode

VSCode is a very powerful text editor which we will use extensively. Get the version for your OS [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
