This homework will refer to something we have not done in class, but which you can easily read up on by yourself. Here is a notebook that [introduces the SIR model](https://floswald.github.io/julia-bootcamp/09-introsir.html). In the homework, I ask you to copy sections of code from there into your homework notebook, which you will then submit.
